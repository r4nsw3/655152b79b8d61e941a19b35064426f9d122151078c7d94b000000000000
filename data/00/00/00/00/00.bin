  |   GoNNER is a tough as hell score-based procedurally-generated 	    |
  |   platformer with roguelike elements. GoNNER is also a story about      |
  |   friendship between Ikk, Death, and a space whale named Sally.	    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You will die. A lot. This is by design, but it's not made to feel     |
  |   unfair. You'll eventually get the hang of GoNNER, so don't lose your  |
  |   head. But even if you do it's okay cause we have a lot of             |
  |   replacement heads you can use.      				    |
  |      								    |
  |   DAILY CHALLENGES! Only playable once a day. Levels are randomly 	    |
  |   generated but in this mode everybody plays the same world and use     |
  |   an identical loadout. Everything resets at midnight (Swedish time,    |
  |   UTC+1). Can you crush your leaderboard foes?          		    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   PROCEDURALLY GENERATED! Every time you play the game the levels will  |
  |   be different and present unique challenges and opportunities.	    |
  |   UNLOCKS! You'll be able to choose from a variety of passive and 	    |	
  |   active abilities at the beginning of each run so be sure to 	    |
  |   experiment with all of them and find the play style that best suits   |
  |   you.								    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   SECRETS! Secret areas exist in the world of GoNNER, and these areas   |
  |   will get you different items that you can then always use from the    |
  |   beginning of each run. We're not going to tell you how you get to     |
  |   these areas or what the criteria is for even finding them because     |
  |   secrets, duh.							    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   LEADERBOARDS! Kill creatures, get combos, score points, and brag to   |
  |   your friends how much better you are than them.  			    |
  |   MUSIC! It's really freaking good.                                     |
  |                                                                         |
